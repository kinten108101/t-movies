Day 1 Fri 21/10: Kickstarted the project at 1PM. Bao solved some issues with webpack and learned that webpack loaders were needed to compile jsx and css. Bao made a prototype site which is a collection of cards, so that Khoa can implement api functionalities on those cards.
Day 2 Sat 22/10: Khoa contacted a programmer who has made apps in Flutter and has some knowledge in ReactJS. With his aid Khoa developed an api-test. Bao drew a concept for UI in Figma, then semi-realized that concept.
Day 3 Sun 23/10: Bao solved a problem with React Router where client-side rendering was not taking place. Have to reroute GET requests to root with backend help. Bao stabilized source dir. TVMazed didn't have a GET interface for obtaining popular movies so we decided to move on to implementing Search. We also learned that other apis are allowed as long as tvmazed api is used. At 2:20 AM of next day, Bao successfully deployed the site to Heroku.
Day 4 Mon 24/10: Khoa solved an issue where bundle script was not created in root but in current dir. It was a petty path syntax issue but we didn't realize. Khoa also implemented search functionality where an input string results in a result list. In the evening he also implemented the much-needed search bar.
